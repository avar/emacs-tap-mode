tap-mode.el - A major mode for editing .tap-files in (X)Emacs

TAP is the Test Anything Protocol, a communication protocol
between unit tests and a test harness.

This mode mainly defines a grammar for syntax highlighting 
of TAP files.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

Put "tap-mode.el" into your load-path and the following
into your ~/.emacs:

  (require 'tap-mode)

To associate tap-mode with .tap files add the following
into your ~/.emacs

  (setq auto-mode-alist
    (append auto-mode-alist
      '(("\\.tap$" . tap-mode))))

To automatically turn on font-lock-mode add the following
into your ~/.emacs

  (add-hook 'tap-mode-hook 'font-lock-mode)

Tested:  i386-linux       with XEmacs    21.4
         i386-linux       with GNU Emacs 21.2.1
         i386-windows-w2k with XEmacs    21.4

This mode is built with help of the
"Emacs language mode creation tutorial" at
http://two-wugs.net/emacs/mode-tutorial.html

Regexes are defined for the following font-lock-faces:

  font-lock-keyword-face
  font-lock-type-face
  font-lock-comment-face
  font-lock-reference-face
  font-lock-doc-string-face
  font-lock-function-name-face

I'm interested in comments/enhancements/bugfixes.
